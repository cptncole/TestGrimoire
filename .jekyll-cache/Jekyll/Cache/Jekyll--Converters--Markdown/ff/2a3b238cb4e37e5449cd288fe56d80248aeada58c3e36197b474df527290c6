I"è<p><strong>4th-level conjuration</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: 90 feet</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (air, a pebble, ash, and water inside a gold inlaid vial worth at least 400gp)</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>You call forth an elemental spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Elemental Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature resembles a bipedal form wreathed in the chosen element, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>

<p>The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you donâ€™t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.</p>

<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spellâ€™s level appears in the stat block.</p>
